            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a motivated Computer Science graduate with hands-on experience in programming, software development, and cloud computing. I bring a blend of technical skills and problem-solving abilities that make me a valuable asset to any team. My goal is to continually grow in the IT sector, developing expertise in software engineering, cloud solutions, and emerging technologies like AI.</p>

            <p>Over the years, I have had the opportunity to gain valuable experience in various roles:</p>

            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Private Tutor at IIE Varsity College:</strong> Provided personalized C# and Java programming tuition to first and second-year students, helping them strengthen their understanding of core concepts, improve coding skills, and successfully complete coursework.</li>
                <li> <strong>Sales and Marketing Specialist / Webmaster at Afzal Fragrances:</strong> Managed sales teams, assisted in R&D of innovative products, and revamped the company's website to a modern WordPress e-commerce platform.</li>
                <li> <strong>Data Capturer and Administrative Assistant at Vrentals Car & Van Hire:</strong> Accurately entered and managed large volumes of data, developed strong attention to detail, and collaborated effectively with team members to improve office efficiency.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>My self-motivated approach to learning and technical acumen enable me to tackle challenges with creativity and precision. I aim to leverage my comprehensive understanding of Computer Science to contribute innovative solutions as a software engineer.</p>

            <p>When I'm not coding or learning about new technologies, I enjoy exploring the latest in software development and cloud computing trends, constantly seeking opportunities to improve and apply my skills in meaningful ways.</p>
